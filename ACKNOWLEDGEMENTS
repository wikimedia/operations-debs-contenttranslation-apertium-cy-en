Many thanks to Kevin Donnelly for helping to integrate his work with Eurfa and
Klebran into the project, see http://www.eurfa.org.uk for more information on
these tools. And for designing the bulk of the system of transfer rules.

The data for English come from the Apertium English to Catalan language pair,
which was developed by the Transducens group at Universitat d'Alacant, and
funded by the Generalitat de Catalunya (Government of Catalonia).

Many thanks to Mark Nodine to allowing his extensive Welsh--English bilingual 
dictionary be used in the project. The original can be found here:

Thanks to the BBC for allowing us to include their substantial bilingual 
list of terminology.

Thanks also to: Prompsit Language Engineering for technical assistance, Tino
Didriksen for help with VISL CG, and Dafydd Francis, Liam Tomkins, Telsa 
Gwynne, Thomas Thurman and others for answering so many questions.
